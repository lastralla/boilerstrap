Boilerstrap (aka Frankenstein)
=================

Version: 0.0.1

A "test" project that integrates [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)!

The goal is to also include other smaller CSS libraries (e.g. JQuery UI) and setup config variables to switch between different components. Example scenario: Use Twitter Bootstrap but plug in HTML5 Boilerplate's reset styles and JQuery UI's Dialog styles, etc.

Caution:
----------
Bootstrap needs Less version 1.3.0+ to compile. Boilerplate comes with version 1.2.1
